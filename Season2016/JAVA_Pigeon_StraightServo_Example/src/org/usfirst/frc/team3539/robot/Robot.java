/**
 * A bare-bones test project using Pigeon for "Go-Straight" servo-ing.
 * The goal is for a basic robot with left/right side drive
 * to automatically hold a heading while driver is holding the top-left
 * shoulder button (Logitech Gamepad).
 *
 * If Pigeon is present on CANbus, or ribbon-cabled to a CAN-Talon, the robot will use the IMU to servo.
 * If Pigeon is not present, robot will simply apply the same throttle to both sides.
 *
 * When developing robot applications with IMUs, it's important to design in what happens if
 * the IMU is disconnected or un-powered.
